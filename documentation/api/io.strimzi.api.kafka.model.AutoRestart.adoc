Connectors and tasks that are in the FAILED state are automatically restarted.

A back-off algorithm is applied to automatic restarts of each connector and it's tasks.
When a connector is failing an auto restart attempt will happen at first and second reconcile then attempts while be delayed
incrementing the time between automatic restarts by 2 minutes up to a maximum of 30 minutes, at which point no further
automatic restarts are attempted, and the connector or tasks are left in the FAILED state.


If you are using a kafka version <3.0.0, only the connector will be restarted not failed tasks.

To disable the automatic restarting of the connector and it's tasks when they are in the FAILED state on a KafkaConnector resource:

[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: strimzi.io/v1alpha1
kind: KafkaConnector
metadata:
    name: my-source-connector
spec:
    autoRestart:
        enabled: false
----

Similarly, a new field in the KafkaMirrorMaker2 spec named autoRestartConnectorsAndTasks with an enabled field value of false can be applied, to disable auto-restarting connectors and tasks.

[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: strimzi.io/v1alpha1
kind: KafkaMirrorMaker2
metadata:
  name: my-mm2-cluster
spec:
  autoRestartConnectorsAndTasks:
    enabled: false
